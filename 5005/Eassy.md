# A short research on Chord Diagram

### Introduction
A [link](https://sysu-zjw.github.io/5005TopVIS/) to my presentation in top VIS to introduce Chord Diagram. 
In simple word, I think chord diagram is almost the best way to embed **directed connected graph**[1]. I fail to find any better insight nor design in Google Scholar, but I do find something impressive on other website. 

### Related Work
In this part, we will see how a directed connected graph can be embed better:

<table border=0 >
        <tr>
            <td  width="50%" align="left" valign="top">  Two same level knowledge interact </td>
            <td width="50%"> <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/nl/nl/pages/deloitte-analytics/articles/onderwijs-resultaten-2015-state-of-the-state.html"> <img src="https://github.com/sysu-zjw/MSBD-2018Fall/blob/master/img/5005Eassy/5005E1.png"></td>
        </tr>
